## Synopsis

The **Paint Calculator** is a hypothetical project that calculates how many gallons of paint would be required to paint a number of rooms.
This project requires Python3 and pip3

## Running

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 app/run.py`

## What we're looking for

* Install Python / Pip
* Run application
* Write Selenium tests against application. They do **not** have to be in Python, and should be in whatever language you are most comfortable with
* Explain any problems you had while writing the tests, and what you did to make it easier. Pointing to localhost for the application is OK
